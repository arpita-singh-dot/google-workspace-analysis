## ðŸ“Š Dataset Provenance

This project uses a **synthetic dataset** (`workspace_usage_simulated.csv`) that mimics Google Workspace usage logs.  

### Why synthetic?
- Real Workspace telemetry is private and inaccessible.  
- Synthetic data allows reproducible, privacy-safe demonstrations.  

### Reproducibility
- Generated using `/scripts/generate_workspace_data.py` (Python, seed=42).  
- Validation results documented in `/docs/validation.md`.  

### Columns
- `employee_id` â€” unique employee code (E0001, E0002â€¦)  
- `department` â€” Sales, Marketing, HR, etc.  
- `week` â€” week index (1â€“12)  
- `emails_sent` â€” number of emails sent that week  
- `meetings_hours` â€” hours spent in meetings  
- `collaboration_load` â€” combined collaboration actions (docs/sheets/etc.)  
- `tasks_completed` â€” tasks done that week  
- `productivity_score` â€” scaled score (0â€“100), derived from above metrics
